The if statement allows a program to carry out different actions depending on the situation.
Use relational operators (< <= > >= == !=) to compare numbers.
Do not use the == operator to compare strings. Use the equals method instead.
Multiple if statements can be combined to evaluate complex decisions.
It is a good idea to design test cases before implementing a program.
To invert a condition, use the ! (not) operator.
