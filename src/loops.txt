A loop executes instructions repeatedly while a condition is true.
The for loop is used when a value runs from a starting point to an ending point with a constant increment or decrement.
You can use a Boolean variable to control a loop.
To compute an average, keep a total and a count of all values.
If your goal is to fnd a match, exit the loop when the match is found.
