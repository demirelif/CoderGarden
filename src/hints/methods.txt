A method is a named sequence of instructions.
Arguments are supplied when a method is called.
The return value is the result that the method computes.
Use a return type of void to indicate that a method does not return a value.
A method may require simpler methods to carry out its work.
A recursive computation solves a problem by using the solution of the same
problem with simpler inputs.
